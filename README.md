### Additional Notes

1. **Client Build for Production**:
   To build the client for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The build output will be located in the `dist` folder.

2. **Server in Production**:
   For production, consider using a process manager like [PM2](https://pm2.io/) to run your Node.js server:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start server.js
   ```

3. **Database**:
   Ensure MongoDB is running locally or remotely accessible through the URI defined in `.env`.

4. **Socket.IO**:
   The client and server communicate in real-time using Socket.IO. Ensure the server URL is properly configured in the client.
